
Even with the mentioned advantages, HelixRM can be inconvenient for small teams, given certain
limitations and challenges that can impact its effectiveness.

The cost of using a resource management system like HelixRM
is often an impediment for smaller organizations that probably wouldn't need
such a complete tool in the first place\cite{lydia_y__chen_2019}.

The complexity of the tool can be overwhelming for first-time users of this kind of systems,
leading to inefficiency as the user struggles with the tool's steep learning curve\cite{the_submission_infrastructure}.

Integrating HelixRM with an already existing infrastructure can be more challenging
than what is worth, as current systems may need to be adapted to accommodate the new tool,
ending up increasing complexity\cite{christian_glaschke__2015}.

It is also worth noting that the tool's pricing information is not readily available,
which can present a barrier for potential users\footnotemark[2].

Knowing all of these shortcomings is essential for organizations to make an informed decision
when considering HelixRM for their requirements management needs.
