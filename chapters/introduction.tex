Requirements management is an essential aspect of effective project development,
as it guarantees that stakeholder needs and objectives are clearly articulated,
recorded, and tracked during the project lifecycle.
Proper requirements management minimizes the risk of scope creep, misunderstandings,
and unmet goals, all of which can greatly affect project success.
